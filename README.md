# ZMK Config For My Corne Keyboard

This is the ZMK config for my Corne keyboard which I use both on my Mac and on my Windows PC. Both are used with a german keyboard layout.

To get the exact same keyboard layout both on macOS and Windows I have implented different layers for each OS.

Additionaly I have added layers to easily switch between QWERTZ and Colemak-DH.

All layer switching is done via the `nav_fn` layer.
